# GITBOX

A dev-tool that helps users visualize their git workflow and repository statistics in an intuitive format. Integrates with any git repository using standard password or SSH public key authentication. This tool is geared towards developers who want a more visual approach to managing their git repositories, including those independently hosted. Instructors or managers can use clear visual indicators of commit reversals and changes over time to make judgement about possible plagiarism or team conflicts, while developers can investigate repository-related issues.
