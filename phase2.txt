How to use:

================================
Edits to features:
Added Features:

Removed Features:
Some features were removed due to time constraints: for example the 
quick stats for a user's overall account were removed due to the 
complexity and time needed to write parsers for these stats. 
Notifications were also removed.

================================
User interactions:
A user can register for an account from the login in page by 
clicking register. They can also login in using the login page
with the default user account being:
Username: user
Password: user

Once logged in the user can search for repos using the repo's 
name, and can add a github repo by clicking the + button next
to the search bar. They can also navigate between different pages
of repos using the pagination buttons on the bottom.

Once the add repo button is clicked the user will be prompted with
a form that asks for a Repor name (required) and a repo url (this will
be the same url used when calling git clone: for example:
https://github.com/chyyran/seiri.git), if the repo is a private
repo, then the user's git credentials, such as for example your github
login can be added in the username and password forms. The example
repo provided (Seiri) does not require a login. 

Once submitted a new repo card will appear, showing the name and 
and language breakdown of the repo. Users can click the x button to
delete a repo. Users can click the repo box, and this will redirect to 
a repo specific page, which has overall statistics for the repo 
(language breakdown, repo history, deletions etc.) Many of these graphs
can be hovered over to see break downs for each contributor. The user
can also click any of the radio buttons associated with a user to see 
the graphs change to be reflective of that specific user's contributions.

The user can also choose to update the statistics of repo to the most
current repo version by clicking the refresh repo button at the top of the
page.

================================
Admin interactions:
The admin can log in using the credentials
Username: Admin
Password: Admin

Once logged in they have access to the admin dashboard, which
allows them to register new users (by clicking the create new
new user button). They can search for users using the user's 
username. They can access actions for each user by click the 
user's listing to get access to buttons that will allow them to
remove a user's account from the website, and to edit a user's 
user name.
