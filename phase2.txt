||          PHASE 2          ||
||                           ||
===============================

*** Tested on Google Chrome, fullscreen *** 

Front-end URL: http://ec2-3-87-7-156.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/

### How to use
================================
Load the page, then:
  - Click login at the top right
  - Follow instructions for User or Admin


### New Features
================================

*** Note: if you wish to test admin functionality of deleting users
    you may want to register a dummy user ***

Added Features:
  * Some features were added while we were working on Phase 2:
    - Admins may promote normal users to by admin 
    - User specific statistics on the Repository page
      * (Added for data-granularity)
    - Able to add private repos / repos that required credentials
    - Deployed using AWS
    - Admins now have all the functionality of the users as well.

Removed Features:
  * Some features were removed due to design decisions: 
    - Quick stats for user dashboard 
      * (Removed because users may wish to explore repositorys for which they are not a contributor)
    - Notifications for message board etc.
      * (Removed because this was out of the scope, and realistically had no need for this)



### User interactions
================================

Default credentials:
  Username: user
  Password: user

Supported actions:
  - Dashboard: (/dashboard)
    * Filter and show repositories based on the name of the repo

      * Credentials if credentials are needed to clone the repository. (eg. Github login)
      * Click "Add Repository", then wait for the repository to show up.
      * Note: Repositories are not added if the `Name` is not specified or 
              relevant credentials are not supplied. The action will take
              longer if the repository is very large.
    * Repository cards:
      * The repository cards show the Name, Remote URL, and Languages of the repository.
      * Deleting the repository:
        * Click the "x" at the top right of the repository to remove.
        * Click confirm to delete.

  - Repository View: (/repository/:id)
    * Clicking on a repo card will bring you to the repository stats page.
    * Note: All statistics are calculated by our server, so if you naviage
      to this page too soon after adding a repo, the webpage will not work.

      * You can zoom, pan and select the graph to show the specific commit

    * Language Breakdown:
      * Shows chart of the languages used by the user.
